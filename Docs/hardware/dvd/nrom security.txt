Sectors are encrypted by DiskID(Key1) and Seed(Key2)

Seeds:
  0: 3
  1: 48
  2: 32512
  3: 28673
  4: 6

Check for the Security Code of 6 BCA marks on the disc, from the 6 positions stored on the BCA encrypted area
The 6 BCA mark positions corrupt the sector data stored on the disc, the BCA data tells the locations.
Disc sectors get decrypted with a DiscID and RandomKey from Seed list. using the MN102H system controller in the DVD drive

Encryption(XOR): DiscID(KEY1) -> RandomKey(KEY2)
Security Check: Get DiscID -> Check BCA Marks -> BOOT
Encryption doesn't have a random key for NR disc instead it's a fixed key after the discID, the fixed key value is 9
